    <h1 align="center">Cooking, an art, an culture</h1>
    <p>Each culture has it's own enviroment, it's own history, it's own development. The acces to food depends on all of them. Japanese work together on rice fields, mexicans discover liquids on cactus, amasonian indias find meat junping between trees, and peruvians eatable roots that were not found anywere at this time, but if comercial interest does not grow with this foods, it just become forgeted. Someting like also happens with the coqued foods.</p>
    <p>A lot of countries and cultires had tried differente preparation with beans: cubans with "moros y cristianos"... dark morisk beans and white pure cristians, frijolitos in central america, and in Chile: beans with rein, or simply beans with spaghetti... let's go on:</p>

                <h2>Cooking</h2>
                    <p>Let's do it.... step by step.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First of all, allways and for ever and ever... order, clean, wash... cooking is like making love.... but got to be very higienic.</li>
                        <li>Put the beans on a pot, or another big enought recipient, with double the hight of watter... if beans are three fingers high, make water be 6 fingers high, and leave them alone and free for a night, they got to absorve water, so they become quicker to cook and soft when eated.</li><br>
                        <li>Cut the vegetables on small pieces, tiny buckets are good.</li>
                        <li>Put some oil on a pot, the oil you choos is up to you, i prefer vegetable oil, couse is less tasteable, and i don't want to mask the other tastes.</li>
                        <li>fried scarped garlic for a few seconds, the idea is make the garlic share its smell and taste with the purest oil i can use, but remeber that burned garlic taste ugly</li>
                        <li>Put the onions and fried still it gets a little translucient</li>
                        <li>Put the carrot, vetch ans papprika, fried a few seconds to seal them</li>
                        <li>Add salt and fried.</li>
                        <li>Add the beans and wather ones again the double the high... ad peeper and every seasoning you wich, cover with the pot's lid and go to see the tv show, or make the beds... you had at least 30 minutes if not 40 to wait... fire the candles on the table or choose the music...</li>
                        <li>Try the beans, if soft, ad the spaghetti full long, or divided on thirds us i do, this is a good time to correct the salty and seasoning, and to call everibody to seat near the table... they allways take some time to do so, spaghetties on the pot will take only 5 minutes to be ready...</li>
                        <li>If you want you can add, when serving on deep plates, some small buckets of chile and tiny pieces of parsley</li><br>
                    </ol>

    <h3>At last, but not at list...</h3>
    <p>Try it one time... make your own changes, and share, on past times, cultures were isolated becouse comunication had suffer of distance, but we are living on a world wide village. <br>Chilean papprika grows on chilean land, with the care of chilean farmers and our fresher air, so it have chilean flavor.... but it is still papprika.... wathever you tried could be usefull here and there...</p>
